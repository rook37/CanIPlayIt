# ðŸŽ® *Can I Play It* ðŸŽ®

## Overview

Can I Play It, a web applicaton which displays a wide database of video games on different platforms and services, that can be sorted through and searched to find various games and the services they're offered on

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Installation


#### 1. Install NPM packages.

- In both /client/CanIPlay and /server, run

  ```sh
  npm i
  ```
#### 2. Set up your database.

- Create a local mysql db named games, with an .env file providing its information to /server/knexfile.js

- In /server, run
  ```sh
  npx knex migrate:latest
  node /helper/insertGames.js
  ```
- This will load the database with the provided data in games.json, which has been gathered from various public APIs.

#### 3. Initialize the server.

- In /server, run

  ```sh
  node index.js
  ```

#### 4. Initialize the client.

- In /client/CanIPlay, run

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

### Data Setup

- /server/helper/data/games.json comes prepopulated with game data, but with the provided API endpoints in an .env file, the data can be rebuilt locally.

- Navigate to /server/helper, then run these files:

#### 1. First, pull all the raw game data:
`node dataScraper.js`

#### 2. Next, we need to build game objects with the IDs we've received
`node xbGameBuilder.js`


#### 3. Then, pull PS+ and their Ubi+ Classics offering
   `node psGameBuilder.js`

#### 4. After that, we need to populate missing fields using the IGDB API
 `node updateIGDB.js`

#### 5. Now, sort through genres and collapse similar ones into one set
`node genreSet.js`

  - Check the log or data/failedGames.json to see if any failed to populate.

#### 6. Finally, your data should be updated and ready to enter the database!
`node insertGames.js`

As mentioned, the data is already provided - but if you want to try it yourself, these are the steps!

## Usage

From the home page, a user can click on a game, navigate through the pages of the database, search, or click on different categories to filter the database by subscription service, platform, or genre. 
  - Filters work with OR, not AND
  - Hovering over a game will pop up with the title and genres

####  Hover:
